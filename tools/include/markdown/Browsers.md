### Browser List Usage

The **Browser List** allows you to manage the installation or removal of supported browsers through a simple checklist interface. 

- **Select** the browsers you wish to install or remove from the list.
- Confirm your selection, and the system will automatically:
  - Install the selected browsers, if not already installed.
  - Remove the selected browsers, if they are currently installed.
